<h1>The Dot Com Bubble </h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The advent of the internet provided another path for consumers to participate in commerce. Amazon and Ebay served as the two key players that pushed the evolution of capitalism. The expansion the internet allowed for a new model of commerce which harnessed the power of the masses. The rise of Amazon and Ebay sparked a cycle of boom, bubble, bust and resurrection.
    </p>
<h2>Amazon & Ebay</h2>
    <p>Amazon was birthed in a Seattle garage by Jeff Bezos. Bezos was a data savant focused on products in demand. He soon found out that books where always in demand. Amazon launched in the Summer of 1995. Ebay was founded by Pierre Omidyar over an extended weekend. Pierre, a software developer, thought it would be cool to develop an efficient marketplace.
        Soon both platforms found success in massive growth aided by the democratization of information and rapid expansion of the internet.
        Boom to Bust
    </p>

    <p>Wall Street took notice of the success of Amazon and Ebay. Coupled with the day trader movement this new wave of technology stated a frenzy. Venture capitalist were funding an excessive number of startups under the theory that only one needs to make it big. The massive success of Amazon drove more deals in the market. Soon Wall Street and the Fed realized the current market activity was unsustainable. To correct the bubble in the market the Fed raised rates. The ensuing correction resulted in the Nasdaq losing two thirds of its value.

Although a lot of jobs were lost many new companies were created as a result of the market crash. The new breed of corporations realized that customer services is key to a firmâ€™s success.
