<h1>Browser Wars</h1>
The video entitled “Browser Wars” focuses on one of the most specific technological advances known as the world wide web. The worldwide web was established in 1989. The web had few web pages that were difficult to find and had little to no substance. This was revolutionized by the invention of the web browser. The browser simplified user integration with the underlying code to allow for everyday individuals to efficiently use the web. The very first browser of this nature was the mosaic browser. This is the pivotal point that the forefathers of the internet dream it could be. A time in history where the web was not only just useful for academics and researchers but conveniently user friendly for all potential users. Jim Clark helped mosaic’s developers get their idea of getting their browser to the homes and desk of millions. Clark invested 1/3 of his total net worth to develop the browser Internationally.
Microsoft came into major play given this very same idea of mosaic. In 1993, Bill Gates and Microsoft erupted as their software was into the devices of 90% of the world. Microsoft knew that they were at the pinnacle of their industry, but they also knew that they could easily be threatened by a much smaller startup. This idealization came to reality when Netscape launch their browser, Navigator. In the computer industry companies that have the most control are the companies that control software platforms. Software programs hold the ability to run programs on top of themselves. By 1995, the internet had become a wide-scale phenom by the revolutionary advancements of not only companies like Microsoft, but also Netscape.
Netscape and Microsoft were into a full-fledged ‘browser war’. This was officially commenced when the Microsoft corp. made a monopolization effort to buy Netscape for 1 million. Microsoft's answer to Netscape’s success was to copy their every move to maintain its top position in the market. Microsoft then made a pivotal chess move. They informed manufacturers that if they don't our internet explore as their distributive browser then they will cancel their Windows OS licenses. They then made a move to make windows completely free integrated into the Windows OS. A move that Netscape did not seem to be able to make since they had no other initial revenue driver. At this point, Microsft had officially won the browser war and Netscape's revenue share had immensely decrease despite their efforts.
Microsoft had won one war, but they also had another daunting opponent on their hands. The US government was taken on Microsoft for movements that are believed to be unethical. Microsft had been involved in a predatory activity to monopolize and wither Netscape business practices. This trail that Microsoft had gone through caused Microsoft to drop 30 Billion overnights.
