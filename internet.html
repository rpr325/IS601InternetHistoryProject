    </body>The History Channel article titled “The Invention of the Internet” focuses on the most influential technical invention of modern-day history. The global network of computer-based communication is known as both an essential asset as well as a toy to millions. While it is an asset of convince is a well conformed war engagement tool. We live in an age where more information is conveyed through the internet than the United States Postal Service can attempt to relay. In the 1990’s the internet was responsible for 1/3rd of the US economic growth.
The article goes on to explain the idealization of the internet and how that came to be. A professor from MIT came up with the original concept in the 1950’s. JCR Licklighter, who was ironically a phycology professor. Before then computers were usually a thought of in the light of sy-fi. Computers began to with-hold a priority in American society when they eventually began to assist in the development of the space program. This was a great priority to be able to compete with their Russian counterparts. These theories that were originally formed were advanced by Dr. L Kleinrock creating queuing theory. This theory also was inspired and developed the telephone technology. Paul Baran came up with hut potatoes routing so traffic can route information in a network even if the information is not complete or whole. Nodes were like a postal office which would keep copies of the packets and would reliever them to their respective locations.
In the 1960’s life was full of simplicity and based on manualism. Massive convince changes occur when the timesharing idea came of place. This was formerly known as resource sharing of information. Dr. Lawrence Roberts help establish and network mainframe computers. Dr. Roberts finalized the ideal titled the ARPAnet and came up with IMP’s or Interface Message Processers along with packet switching. This idea was carried out with 4 identical devices; three in California and 1 in Utah.     This idea is one of the most crucial developmental points for the modern-day internet as we know it to be.
The next crucial development progression is known as email or electronic mail. This was one of the first programming applications to be used by the first users of the internet. Then an idea called LAN or Local Area Network and WAN Wide Area Network was developed. These processes. The internet was a great concept, but it was also filled with various different technicalities/vulnerabilities that posed threats to the greater usage.
The online world at that point took on a more conspicuous structure in 1990's, when Tim Berners-Lee created the World Wide Web. The online world at that point took on a more conspicuous structure in 1990's, when Tim Berners-Lee created the World Wide Web. This was magnified by thousands to because of the invention of the first browser. While it's regularly mistaken for the web itself, the web is in reality simply the most widely recognized methods for getting to information online as sites and hyperlink.
