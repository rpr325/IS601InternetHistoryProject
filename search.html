The video presentation entitled ‘Internet Search’ the roots of ‘search’ go all the way back to Stanford University. The creators of yahoo Jerry and David had an idea of creating a location where they can see the most up to date information on sports stats. Yahoo was a great idea, but in order to pursue upon that idea Yahoos founders knew they would need cash. Yahoo had no revenue, so they turned to a venture capitalist form. At this time many companies involved with internet knew that it was possible to be able to make money and large amounts of it, but they just weren’t sure how. This is when the light bulb clicked, and they came up with the idea to use their platforms traffic to generate ad revenue. Yahoo was concerned, because they were worried of the commercialization of there platform. They felt it would potentially turn away their loyal users, but this was not the case. Yahoo found that their user numbers multiplied, and they also drew more attention from advertisers.
Yahoo knew there was more to be done as the competition grew. Thus, the birth of the query search bar. Once Yahoo and other search engines realized their notch to satisfy their advertisers, they lost something in the process. Search engines slowly pivoted there focus from search and the quality and reliable of search became less of a guarantee. Most searches were not ‘first click’ efficient.
The need for better birthed one of the most influential companies the world has ever seen, Google. The founders of Google realized the idea of relevancy. So, the more a site is clicked on the relevancy is determined father. Google built is algorithmic foundation upon this idea and it found it success. Ironically through it all excite had a chance to buy google for around 1 million dollars. Google wanted to universalize searching and in order to do this they needed the investments of venture capitalist to grow their organization.
Google still had a major issue. They could not exactly figure how to make money and generate advertisements in a user-friendly manner. They realized they can sell keywords and search data statistics are valuable for advertisers can know what audience they should focus upon. They also realized that instead of traditional ad banners they could get advertisers to pay large amounts for top search query results. Today this leads to some people believe that Google within hold a somewhat eerie amount of personal information.
