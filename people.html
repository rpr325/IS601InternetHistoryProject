<h1>People Power</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>After the Dot Com Bubble access to information continued to be democratized. The new wave of technology allowed for disruption of traditional media. People now had the power to create, produce and distribute. The Web 2.0 era was not without its bumps. Some ventures ran afoul of copyright laws. However, when the dust settled the media landscape was forever changed.
</p>
<h2>MP3</h2>
<p>Media was forever changed with the advent of the MP# file. Now massive media files could be shared and played on a personal computer. Soon movies would follow, and this meant there was a whole new way for users to enjoy media online.
</p>
<h2>Web 2.0</h2>
<p>The Web 2.0 era saw a wave of innovative startups enter the market with products focused on the people. YouTube inspired users to broadcast themselves, Facebook facilitated connecting and engaging over a network and Digg made their user base the curators for news content. The internet became a place of user generated content and sharing. In the internet people had a platform in which views could be shared and connections made. The startups of the Web 2.0 era built on the internet technology wave to give the people what they want.
While most ought to build their enterprise for money others found a way to harness the people for good. The internet was fertile ground for crowd sourced resources such as Craigslist and Wikipedia. Information is truly unleased in the information age and all can take part.
